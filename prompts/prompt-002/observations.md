## Observations for Prompt 002

*Only for ChatGPT3.5*

- The output was not done correctly (I asked for TSV, it gave me space separated values)
- Responses seemed shorted than 001
- As expected, responses are generally different than 001
- Specifying no commentary/summary seemed to have worked (The only output was the table)
- The strategy specified in 002 was more general than 001 (which would be more useful for categorization)

### A look at responses (are we getting roughly the expected results?)
- Response 3 is not fitting to the situation. Compensatory time off would only be negotiable if he went in to work.
- Response 4 is not necessarily inappropriate but depends on the manner of speaking and further context.
- Response 6 is tagged as "appropriate". Depending on the manner of speaking this could be inappropriate.


## For next prompt
- specify a column for the response number
- specify the output format to be a markdown table
- specify not to quote the response
- specify the speaking mode
- specify that the response must logically fit the situation
