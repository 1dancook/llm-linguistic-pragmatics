Pragmatically Appropriate Responses:

1. **Polite Request:**
   - "I understand the urgency, but is there any way we can discuss an alternative solution that doesn't involve me working on the holiday?"

2. **Negotiation:**
   - "I'm willing to help out in this situation, but can we work out some compensation or time off in lieu for working on a national holiday?"

3. **Expressing Concern:**
   - "I have prior commitments, but if it's absolutely necessary, I'll do my best to rearrange things. Can we discuss the details and find a compromise?"

4. **Compliance with Conditions:**
   - "I'll come in for overtime on the holiday, but can we confirm that my dedication to the job will be acknowledged and reflected appropriately?"

5. **Seeking Clarification:**
   - "I want to make sure I fully understand the situation. Can you provide more information on why my presence is crucial on the national holiday and if there are any alternatives?"

Pragmatically Inappropriate Responses:

1. **Defiance:**
   - "I don't care if you fire me. I'm not working on a damn holiday!"

2. **Insulting the Boss:**
   - "You must be out of your mind if you think I'm sacrificing my holiday for this crap. Find someone else, idiot."

3. **Ignoring the Request:**
   - *No response, simply ignoring the request or not acknowledging it.*

4. **Passive-Aggressive Response:**
   - "Sure, I'll come in and ruin my holiday just to make you happy. Great way to show appreciation for your employees."

5. **Inappropriate Humor:**
   - "You want me to work on a holiday? Is this a joke? Did I accidentally sign up for a stand-up comedy show?"
