## Observations for prompt-06

- The overall interaction is great and what is expected
- The evaluation from chatGPT is fairly good - it gives useful advice on how to respond to the scenario without giving it away
- Somewhat humurously, the evaluation was also quite strict about how to respond (given the Candy Crush gaming issue)
- The second scenario in the transcript is somewhat difficult in the sense that it wasn't obvious who I should respond to
- One improvement from here could be to try and get chatGPT to prompt the user in a more obvious way, i.e. "Try again" or "Great, here's a new scenario."
- Another improvement could be that the scenario demands a response to a person and that chatGPT writes that out.
