## set-02

This will only use chatGPT 3.5.

The purpose of this set is to explore if ChatGPT can be kick-started into a loop of first giving a scenario, then asking for a response, and providing an evaluation until the response is appropriate.

The transcript will be recorded in the relative folder's `transcript.md` file.

Expected production from chatGPT:

- It should provide a scenario in easy English
- It should allow the user to write a response
- It should evaluate the response in Japanese
- It should ask for another response if the response was not appropriate

Results:

- set-02/prompt-06 had a great result 
- Overall this was quite difficult to get to the expected result even with very clear and concise instructions.
