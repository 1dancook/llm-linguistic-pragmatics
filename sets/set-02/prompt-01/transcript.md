> It's important to approach team issues with a collaborative and constructive mindset. While it's understandable that you're frustrated with Sarah's lack of contribution, the response here seems confrontational and may escalate the situation. Instead of immediately resorting to reporting and threatening consequences, consider a more diplomatic approach that encourages open communication and seeks a resolution. Let's try again with a more constructive response.

**You**

> Sarah, how are things going? I noticed that you missed a deadline again. Are you having a difficult time with a particular aspect of the assignment?

It opens the door for Sarah to express any challenges or difficulties she may be facing, fostering communication rather than confrontation. This approach is likely to yield more information about the underlying issues and could lead to a more constructive solution for the entire team. Well done!
