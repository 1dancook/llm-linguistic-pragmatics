## Observations for prompt-03

- Very inconsistent initial responses when using the Japanese prompt
- Reverting back to the English prompt yielded better initial responses

**Why?**

- It could be a matter of semantics with Japanese.
- It could be a matter of the structure of the prompt itself.

## For next prompt

- Structure the prompt well in English
