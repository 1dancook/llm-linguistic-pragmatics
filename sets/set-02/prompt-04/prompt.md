Goal: I want to practice pragmatic responses to scenarios in English. 

Instructions: 
- Step 1: In order to do accomplish the goal, you will provide a single scenario in easy English and prompt me for a response. 
- Step 2: Prompt me with "What is your response?"
- Step 3: After I write a response you will write an evaluation of my response entirely in Japanese. The evaluation should explain why my response is pragmatically appropriate or not.
- Step 4: After you write an evaluation, if you think that I need to try again with another response, please ask then evaluate.
