I want to practice pragmatic responses to scenarios. The responses should be something I need to say.

First, Tell me about a scenario that will require a response.

Then, let's take turns doing this until my response is pragmatically appropriate to the scenario:
    1. I will write a response.
    2. You will write an evaluation of my response. If I need to revise my response, tell me  to try again.
