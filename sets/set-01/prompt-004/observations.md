## Observations for 004

*Only for ChatGPT*

- The `Strategy` column is different than in previous responses.
    - **Thought:** It will be better to specify what this column should be about, or provide a better column name.
    - The semantics involved are important!

- Perhaps related to the above, the `Discourse Type` seems to contain strategies employed.

- ChatGPT did not respect the instruction about not quoting the responses even though it is even more explicit
    - **Thought:** This is trivial and could just be removed.

## For Next Prompt

- Provide more specific names and descriptions for columns
- Specify several new columns (features) for the output
- Specify output to be CSV and pipe separated
- Organize output instructions to be in it's own section
- Change "Output Requirements" to "Output Format Requirements"
