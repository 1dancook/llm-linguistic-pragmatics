## Observations on prompt 001

*This was only for chatGPT3.5*

- The LLM was prompted for appropriate and inappropriate responses
    - The inappropriate responses seemed to assume certain things about the employee
    - Next: It may be important to give more relevant context

- It classified the responses with the strategy it employed without being asked (is this desired?)

- The output format is not nice - would be great to be in a table format

- It's not very vulgar, but maybe the context provided doesn't quite warrant it (i.e. why would the man be vulgar?)

**Thought**: The more context given, the more fitting the responses will be.

## For next prompt
- specify output format (table with columns, etc.)
- specify not adding any commentary or summary
- specify adding the strategy it employs
- specify MORE context for the man (maybe about what is happening at home)

## Other
- For another prompt, give less context
