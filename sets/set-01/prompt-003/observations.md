## Observations for Prompt 003

*Only for ChatGPT 3.5*

- The expected results for the `Speaking Mode` column were categories like "yelling", "whispering", etc.
    - **Thought:** The idea for `Speaking Mode` was to get have more context about the response itself. ChatGPT produced a discourse type. A `Discourse Type` may be more useful as a category than a speaking mode.

- Rather than writing out expletives, ChatGPT 'muted' them with `[expletive]`.
    - **Question**: Will ChatGPT produce expletives if instructed to do so?

- The markdown formatted table worked along with all of the specified columns.

- ChatGPT did not listen to instructions about not quoting the responses.

### Notes on the responses
- Response 3 is not fitting. There is no offer being made.

## For Next Prompt

- change `Speaking Mode` column name to `Discourse Type`
- specify that explitives can be included and should be written out

## For Another Prompt
- Get the output into CSV format with the delimiter as a pipe character ("|")
