| 1      | I understand the importance of the holiday, but I have personal commitments. Is there any way we can find an alternative solution?                  | Appropriate   | Negotiation            | Request             | Concerned    | Polite           | None  |
| 2      | I'll be there, but I hope this doesn't become a regular thing. We all deserve a break on holidays.                                                  | Appropriate   | Expressing Displeasure | Complaint           | Resigned     | Casual           | None  |
| 3      | You can't fire me for not working on a national holiday. That's against the labor laws.                                                             | Appropriate   | Assertiveness          | Assertion           | Defiant      | Formal           | None  |
| 4      | You know what, go ahead and fire me. Working on a national holiday is ridiculous.                                                                   | Inappropriate | Defiance               | Assertion           | Angry        | Rude             | None  |
| 5      | I have plans for the holiday, and I won't be able to make it. If you fire me over this, I'll be forced to take legal action for unfair termination. | Appropriate   | Threat                 | Warning             | Assertive    | Formal           | None  |
| 6      | F*** that! I'm not coming in. Fire me if you want, but you can't treat people like this.                                                            | Inappropriate | Defiance               | Assertion           | Angry        | Rude             | None  |
| 7      | I'll come in, but you owe me big time for this. This better reflect in my next evaluation.                                                          | Appropriate   | Negotiation            | Request             | Resigned     | Casual           | None  |
| 8      | You're really going to make me choose between my job and a national holiday with my family? That's messed up.                                       | Appropriate   | Expressing Displeasure | Complaint           | Upset        | Casual           | None  |
| 9      | Fine, I'll come in, but I expect double pay for working on a holiday.                                                                               | Appropriate   | Negotiation            | Request             | Resigned     | Casual           | None  |
| 10     | Fire me? Go ahead. I'd rather be unemployed than work for someone who doesn't respect personal time.                                                | Appropriate   | Defiance               | Assertion           | Defiant      | Casual           | None  |
